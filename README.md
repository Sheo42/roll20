My roll20 shit

Copy/paste Climat.js into the API.
Use !climat in the chat to start it.

## Character tools (API scripts, GM only)

Three small scripts to inspect a character's attributes from the server side, without opening its
sheet in a browser. Opening a sheet from a session that did not receive the character's attributes
makes the Pathfinder sheet recreate its default attributes, which leaves duplicates behind.
Paste each file in a new API script (Game Settings > API Scripts), save, restart the sandbox.

| Script | Command | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pjinfo.js` | `!pjinfo Nom du Personnage` | Read-only. Whispers race, level, alignment, deity, age, languages, classes, ability names, number of duplicated attributes and of same-named handouts. |
| `dupes.js` | `!dupes Nom du Personnage [tout]` | Read-only. Groups duplicated attribute names, compares values, and decodes the creation date from the Firebase-style ids to tell the oldest copy from the recent ones. |
| `dedup.js` | `!dedup Nom du Personnage` then `!dedup Nom du Personnage confirmer N` | Deletes duplicates. Dry run by default; deletion only with the exact count shown by the dry run. |
| `tokeninfo.js` | `!tokeninfo Nom du Personnage`, `!tokenwatch on\|off` | Read-only diagnostic for token naming. `!tokeninfo` shows the default token's name, its bar links and the tokens already placed. `!tokenwatch` whispers each token creation and every rename (old and new name) for 15 minutes, to find which script renames tokens. |

`dedup.js` keeps the oldest copy of every attribute and only removes recent copies created inside
`WINDOW_FROM`..`WINDOW_TO` (UTC, edit them at the top of the file) that have the same value and max as the
kept one. It never touches `repeating_` sections. Run `dupes.js` first to pick the window, and
duplicate the character beforehand if you want a backup.
